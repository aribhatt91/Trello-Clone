## What's in there?

An overly simplified clone of Trello (or any Kanban board you can think of) with very basic functionality like create cards, set due dates, edit and remove existing tasks, assign people, and drag and drop cards as you progress through your tasks.

Build in vanilla JS without any fancy library - except for the date picker and, probably in future - for state management and analytics dashboard.
